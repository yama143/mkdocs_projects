# Twitter Bots

We built some twitter bots to help folks stay up-to-date when things are reported to public data sources.

## @BotNebraska
---------------------

The bot that started it all..  our first-born baby-bot.  Probably the most relevant to follow if you are interested in campaign finance in Nebraska.  BotNebraska only tweets the most interesting contributions and expenditures reported by the NADC.

## @bytenebraska
---------------------
The bytenebraska bot is a VERY busy bot.  This guy likes to tweet EVERYTHING reported by the NADC.  Every single contribution & expenditure reported by the NADC.

## @rickettsbot
---------------------
Governor Pete Ricketts is a very prolific contributor to campaigns in Nebraska.  Notably, his monetary influence has been granted to a large portion of the state legislature.  Past contributions also include donations to committees dedicated to reinstating the death penalty, anti-abortion & anti-gambling groups as well as groups wishing to enact voter id laws.  

There's no question that Pete has been very influential in Nebraska politics.  However, his choice to use money in leiu of debate to influence those around him gives us pause to question the democratic nature of current campaign finance limits in Nebraska... you know... because... there really aren't a lot of those limits.  

Check out @RickettsBot if you'd like to stay up-to-date on the financial influence of Goveronor Pete Ricketts

## @JBothert
---------------------

It's up to you as to whether Nebraska's current campaign finance laws allow for legalized corruption at multiple levels of government.  Maybe take a peak at what the Mayor of Omaha receives and from whom to help you decide.

## @WatchfulBotizen (FCC Stuff)
---------------------
Keep up to date on political advertising in our wonderful corn & beef state. 

Unlike any of the other Data Nebraska bots, WatchfulBotizen likes to keep an eye on political filings to the FCC.  This bot queries the FCC's open data API (IT WAS VERY COOL OF THE FCC TO BUILD THIS).  Anything WatchfulBotizen finds filed by Nebraska Radio and Television stations, it tweets.
